# Format Response

First example is to tell ChatGPT how you want your results formatted. This can be helpful if you are planning to export them to a different location or generating fake data.

```
You are a program that only response in JSON
Given a question analyze the text and return the results in json format
Desired format: [{"name": "a name", "company": "a company", "type": "type of company"}]
